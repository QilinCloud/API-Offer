# Qilin.Cloud/API/Offer

The Offer API is used to manage offers. An offer always needs a product as a base to which the offer refers. The product is not merchant-specific (because it describes a product in general), but the offer is.
The offer describes the details at which a merchant wants to offer a product on a specific channel.

### :bulb: Example:

*For the product "Coca Cola, glass bottle, 0.4L", a merchant creates the offer "6-pack, 10 pieces available in stock, each at a price of 4.00 US dollars with a delivery time of 2-4 days". This and similar offer data are managed by the Offer API.*
